# Yggdrasil

> **Harness relationship graph for Claude Code, inside VS Code.**

Yggdrasil walks your active workspace, reads every Claude Code surface (`settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.mcp.json`, `skills/`, `memory/`, hooks, plugins, permissions), and renders **how they connect** — not just *what exists*.

## Why another Claude Code tool?

There are already great extensions for browsing skills, listing MCP servers, and tracking session activity. None of them show **relationships**. A skill says it `requires-tool Bash` — which one? A plugin claims to *own* a skill — show me the link. A permission `allow` and a `deny` collide on the same pattern — make it impossible to miss. That is the gap Yggdrasil fills.

| Claude Code Tool Manager | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Claudia / opcode | ✓ | — | — | — | — |

## Features

- **Harness parser** — merges every layer of Claude Code config (user / project / local / plugin) into one validated model, capturing skill frontmatter and SKILL.md body references.
- **Sidebar Harness tree** — every category (Skills, Hooks, MCP, Memory, Permissions, Rules, CLAUDE.md, Env) with source grouping and per-plugin namespace folders. ![Sidebar](media/screenshots/sidebar.png)
- **Blueprint graph** — react-flow + ELK layout. Workspace on the left, then layered columns flowing in the order Claude Code actually loads things. Custom Card nodes per kind, colored animated relationship edges, search, layout switcher, plugin/env/permission toggles, MiniMap.
- **Seven relationship edge kinds** — `owns`, `shadows`, `conflicts`, `requires-tool`, `references`, `invokes`, `declared-in`. All derived purely from the parsed harness, no extra IO.
- **Static analyzer** — five inconsistency rules surfaced via the standard `Problems` panel and a dedicated *Inconsistencies* sidebar category. Nodes flagged by the analyzer get a red badge in the graph.
- **Sessions watcher** — tails `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl` for the active workspace and pings you when Claude Code is waiting on `AskUserQuestion`, `ExitPlanMode`, or a permission request.

## Install

While in preview:

```bash
code --install-extension yggdrasil-0.1.0.vsix
```

After Marketplace publish:

```
ext install yusuke-oki-06.yggdrasil
```

## Quickstart

1. Open any Claude Code workspace in VS Code.
2. Click the 🌳 **Yggdrasil** icon in the Activity Bar.
3. From the sidebar header, run **`Yggdrasil: Open Blueprint`** (or use the command palette).
4. Use the toolbar to filter, switch layout direction, or reveal plugin skills / env vars / permissions.

## Settings

| | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `yggdrasil.notifications.enabled` | `true` | Show a notification when a Claude Code session needs your input. |
| `yggdrasil.parser.memoryRoot` | `""` | Override the inferred Claude Code memory directory. |

## Inconsistency rules

| Rule | Severity | Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| `skill.duplicate-name` | warning | Two skills share the same `name`. |
| `skill.missing-description` | warning | A skill has no `description` in frontmatter. |
| `mcp.missing-env` | warning | An MCP server references `${KEY}` that is not in `settings.json` or the shell. |
| `hook.empty-command` | warning | A hook entry has no command to run. |
| `plugin.missing-install` | warning | An enabled plugin is missing from `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`. |

## Loading-order layout

The Blueprint puts **Claude Code itself in the middle**, with the harness flowing into it from the left and the runtime triggering out to the right:

```
CLAUDE.md / rules  →  plugins / env  →  skills / MCP / memory  →  Claude Code  →  hooks  →  tools / permissions  →  config files
       L0                  L1                    L2                     L3            L4              L5                 L6
   foundation         declared            composed                 assembled       events         runtime              meta
```

Visual position teaches the system. Skills sit *to the left of* Claude (loaded into it); hooks sit *to the right* (triggered by it). Within each category column, entries are sorted by **source precedence** — project overrides at the top, then local, user, plugin — and prominent **`overrides`** edges connect higher-priority entries to the ones they shadow so you can see at a glance which definition wins.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # esbuild watch (extension + WebView bundle)
# Press F5 in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run package      # build .vsix
```

The repo holds two TypeScript projects: the extension (`src/`, Node CJS) and the React WebView (`media/blueprint/`, browser IIFE). Both are bundled by `esbuild.config.mjs`.

## Roadmap

- Click-to-focus subgraph (1-2 hop neighborhood around a selected node).
- Edge-kind filter chips on the toolbar (toggle `invokes`, `shadows`, etc. independently).
- Selected-node detail panel with incoming / outgoing edge listing.
- Slack-webhook variant of the input-required notification.
- Plugin → Hook / MCP `owns` extraction (parser extension).
- Memory-to-memory cross-reference detection.
